A possible way to build our own facial recognition algorithm:

Extract the face descriptors and use KNN to train our own classifier.
get the cropped face picture

1. Obtains specific points that exist on every face
2. Use OpenCVâ€™s affine transformation to do basic image transformations to make the eyes and lip, etc, always appear in the same location.
3. The face imaged are passed through a deep CNN to obtain a unit hypersphere.
4. Use ML classification method
